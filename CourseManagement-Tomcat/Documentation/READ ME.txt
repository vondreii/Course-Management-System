-- Setting up the Database:

-- Context.xml (META-INF > context.xml)

	The database being used is c3220929_db. 
	
	The following setting should already configured in context.xml:
	username = "c3220929"
	password = "020296"
	url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/SENG2050_2017" 

	depending upon whether you are connected in uni or home, the 'url' attribute needs to be changed.
	
	url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/SENG2050_2017"  
		- ( If accessing from uni)
	
	url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:30001/SENG2050_2017"  
		- ( If accessing from home - 30001 or whichever port chosen, because that is the port we are tunneling through )

-- DatabaseFunctions.java (WEB-INF > classes > nuboardpkg > DatabaseFunction.java)

	Check that:
	MySQLURL = "jdbc:mysql://teachdb/c3220929_db"; ( If accessing from uni)
    	MySQLURL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:30001/c3220929_db"; // ( If accessing from home )


-- User Management
A tomcatusers.xml has been provided with the users and roles that our system uses for our user management. 
Move this into the apache-tomcat-8.5.16/conf folder.

DatabaseFunction.java is the main java file that connects to the database. The database configuration is already in the java files.

The database c3220929 is already populated with data, but the sql data and tables have been provided.
They are in the databases folder.
