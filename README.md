## Overview ##
NewBoard is an assignment submission and marking system designed with the purpose of improving the existing ‘Blackboard’ system. 
NewBoard attempts to achieve this by including existing features of Blackboard while making it easier for staff and students to 
communicate with each other regarding assignment results, and by giving students a more comprehensive ability to track their grades 
and view their progress towards their future academic goals. NewBoard is also designed with the purpose of making it easier for 
staff to complete potentially mundane and repetitive tasks such as marking, calculating late submission grades and uploading assignments 
so that they can get back to engaging with the students as quickly as possible. Made with Java, jsp and SQL.


## Features ##
Features which are currently functioning in this version of NewBoard are outlined as follows: Students, course coordinators and other 
teaching staff can log into the NewBoard system with their personal accounts to view the information pertaining to the courses they 
are enrolled in. All users can also log out of their session via a link at the top right of the page. Students can view announcements, 
lectures and laboratory content as well as a discussion forum for each of their courses. Students can submit adverse requests for 
assignments. Students can create and reply to threads in the discussion forum for a course. Staff can create announcements, course 
materials and forums. Staff can create and reply to threads in the a forum. Staff can view all assignment submissions. Coordinators 
can do all of the abilities of a staff member with the added ability to view adverse requests. Late deductions are applied automatically. \
\
Pending features that intend to be added includes easier management of group submissions and automating the sorting of individual assignments
into their own student folders while they are being downloaded. \
